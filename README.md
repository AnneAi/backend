# Back Ann

Backend of the chat platform in NodeJs. The app is deployed on Heroku.

## Development server

Run `node server.js` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` using postman for example to access the API (described below). Use `nodemon` instead of `node` if you want the app to automatically reload when any of the source files is changed.

## Folder architecture

- `database`: contains all the database configs (`/config`), models (`/models`), controllers (`/controllers`) and migrations schemas (`/migrations`). The ORM used is [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/) and the DBMS is PostgreSQL on Heroku.

- `websocket`: contains all the events (`/events`) handled by the websocket server. It also contains the `sockets` object that stores all the running chat rooms with the connected clients.

- `routes`: contains all the functions executed for each route of the API (described below).

- `test`: contains all the testing files. `Mocha` and `Chai` are used for unit tests. To perform the tests run `npm test`. First a local PostgreSQL database has to be setup if you want all of the tests to succeed (see below).

## 1. Database

#### PostgreSQL

The DBMS used is PostgreSQL. First you need to install PostgreSQL on your computer to have the backend working properly locally. To connect manually to a local database run `sudo -u <username> psql <database>`. The `<database>` parameter is optional.

Useful commands:

- `\l`: list databases

- `\dt`: list tables

- `\q`: quit psql

If you connect by specifying a `<database>` name you can then write SQL queries in the console to retrieve data from the tables.

#### Sequelize

The ORM used is [sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/). It is helpful for database migration, seeding and requesting. Once PostgreSQL is setup on your computer, run `./prepare.sh`. It will create the database `jenyai` defined in `database/config/config.json` and the tables defined by the models in the `database/models/` folder. This script has to be run each time a schema in the database is created, modified or deleted.

Here are some useful commands used to generate new schemas (which also means create new tables) and populate them with data:

- `sequelize model:generate --name <model_name> --attributes <atttr1>:<type1>,<atttr2>:<type2>`: generates a new model with the associated migration. It automatically creates `id`, `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields.

- `sequelize seed:generate --name <seed_name>`: generates a new seeder.

More information can be found on the [official website](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/).

#### Tables

Here are listed the name of the existing tables and their purpose:  

- `conversations`: stores all the conversations the students had with a teacher or the agent.

- `rooms`: stores all the available chat rooms a user can connect to.

- `waitinglist`: used to store the email of the people that subscibe from the landing page.

## 2. Websocket

The websocket folder is composed of the subfolders:

- `events`: contains the event handlers for the events triggered from the chat interface.

- `managers`: contains the utilities that are used to manage a room or a user.

- `middlewares`: contains the middlewares used to protect the event handlers. They act like a route guard.

#### Events

Here are listed all the events either received from the chat interface or emitted to it.

###### Received

---

- `init`: initializes a connection with a user.

> **token**: string - an encrypted string that contains information about the user. The token has to be valid otherwise the connection is refused (see `utils/tokenManager.js` for more information on the token format).

## 3. Routes

Here are described the existing routes of the API. To test the routes locally, a tool such as Postman is required.

The routes deal with the management of:

- `conversations`: retrieve the logs of all the conversations so far.

- `rooms`: handle the basic CRUD operations to manage the available chat rooms.

The different route sections are like applications that can be plugged easily to the API router (`router/index.js`). To extend the API you only have to create a new folder in the `router/` one, create inside an `index.js` that is a router (it lists all the routes of the new section), and insert it in the API one. The API is at the moment not protected using token but for security puposes it is a must-have.
